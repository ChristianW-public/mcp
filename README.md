This is a demonstration project.

It shows two mcp servers.

The project coding-guidelines shows just reading access to an external source of knowledge.
The project mcp-simple-versioning demonstrates how to write to an external system (here the filesystem).

Both projects are just for educational purpose!

The projects are tested with jdk 21.
